# Building and Testing a Chatbot VR Training Simulation

This repository contains the final [paper](https://github.com/bshpringer/UVA-capstone-project/blob/master/Capstone_Final_Paper.pdf) and [presentation](https://github.com/bshpringer/UVA-capstone-project/blob/master/SIEDS_presentation.pdf) for my yearlong capstone project for the masters in data science program at UVA. The paper was submitted and accepted to the [SIEDS 2019 conference](http://bart.sys.virginia.edu/sieds19/). This project was sponsored by the Army Research Laboratory.

Over the course of the year, our team built a virtual reality training simulation that was capable of classifying a user's spoken input, and of providing appropriate feedback based on what the user said. The chatbot was intended to be used as a training tool to improve U.S. army officer interactions with Chinese officers; however, there are potentially larger implications of this work, as there are many situations in which spoken input training can be used as a substitute for traditional training methods.

The paper included in this repository details the data collection process that was necessary to train the speech classifier. It includes somewhat unique methods to train a chatbot, given that our team had no data to begin with.

In the future, we hope to publish additional papers which detail the classification and VR pieces of the final product.
